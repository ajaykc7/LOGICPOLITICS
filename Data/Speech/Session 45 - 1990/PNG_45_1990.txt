On behalf of the Government and peopleof Papua New Guinea, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of theforty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with your ableleadership and guidance the Assembly will deal with its work in a positive andconstructive manner. I also wish to place on record my country's appreciation ofthe contribution made by your predecessor, Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria,to the work of the Assembly last year.We acknowledge that the world of today is highly volatile and interdependent,and the need for an organization such as the United Nations is more important todaythan ever before. New challenges are now being faced within the framework of theUnited Nations system. The United Nations, we believe, provide the appropriateforum ,or the international community to solve problems through consultation anddialogue, without the need to resort to violence. The achievements, over theyears, of the United Nations system are commendable, particularly in the areas ofdisarmament, decolonisation, the environment, economic development, social justice and the maintenance of world peace. The United Nations can contribute further to international stability and social harmony, but this can occur only through goodwill and with the tolerance and understanding of all member nations. Papua New Guinea is committed to the United Nations and what it represents, and will continue to play its part in achieving world peace and harmony. Complex problems and challenges continue to face us this year, but the Assembly is convening at a time of great hope, a time of profound changes in relationships between nations. We have witnessed a marked improvement in East-West relations, particularly between the Super-Powers. The era of the cold war is vanishing, bringing hope, opportunity and, for some, uncertainty. Massive shifts in the world political order will invariably be reflected in changing economic relationships. We acknowledge with satisfaction the comprehensive report by the Secretary-General, particularly with regard to the United Nations involvement in the achievement of independence for Namibia and progress in negotiations for peaceful settlements of regional conflicts in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Western Sahara, Central America, South Africa and, more recently, the Persian Gulf. The report also addresses other pressing issues such as human rights, drugs, disarmament, the environment, trade, finance and debt servicing. Although major conflicts and tensions may appear to be peripheral to us in the South Pacific, we are not immune to their effects. We feel their impact on our economy, our international obligations, and our moral convictions. I speak today in full awareness of the international media publicity, both positive and adverse, that Papua New Guinea has attracted over the past two years. The increased activity in our petroleum and mining sectors, the closure of the Bougainville copper mine in May last year and the subsequent unrest in that province of our country have focused attention on Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately for Papua New Guinea, the Bougainville and law-and-order crises have tended to attract more attention than the many positive developments taking place in the country. Like many developing countries we have our share of problems, and we are addressing them with energy and determination. Initiatives have been taken by my government to promote economic growth, to further develop education and training opportunities, particularly in tertiary and technical areas, and to generate employment and income opportunities. At the same time. we are developing the capacity of the public service and strengthening law-enforcement agencies. As a result of the closure of Bougainville mine, my government, with the help of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international and national aid agencies, has developed an integrated structural adjustment programme to assist Papua New Guinea through a difficult series of short-term problems. Among other things, the programme will ensure that major resources are progressively developed for the benefit of the country and its people. A first round of negotiations with Bougainville leaders produced an accord and the basis for the restoration of services by the national Government to that troubled island. My Government is committed to continued peaceful dialogue with the people of Bougainville that together we can achieve an amicable settlement of the crisis and a return to normalcy. The South Pacific Community is made up predominantly of small, island States, scattered throughout a vast ocean. For a long time our interests and well-being have been accorded the lowest priority by world military and economic Powers. We are vitally concerned about our region. Like others, we in the Pacific wish to develop under conditions of peace and security. Most Pacific nations depend on a small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export income. For these reasons we concluded the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty, The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific region, and the Convention for the Prohibition of Drift-net Fishing in the South Pacific. We therefore strongly deplore nuclear activities and the dumping of toxic waste , which threaten our fragile ecosystems. We also view with deep concern wanton exploitation of our resources. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It also ushers in the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Papua New Guinea urges that the progress of decolonisation should be accelerated and strengthened as part of the present favourable disposition surrounding the work of the United Nations. We are pleased that positive measures are continually being pursued in New Caledonia by the French authorities to provide a framework for a peaceful evolution of the Territory towards an act of self-determination and independence. We urge that any act of self-determination should be consistent with United Nationsprinciples and practices, and that all options, including independence, should be open.In order that a well-informed decision may be made, the Administering Authority and others should further expand their assistance for education and training, in particular for the Kanak population.  New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the United Nations to continue tomonitor developments in New Caledonia. It is our express hope that the Administering Authority will facilitate regular visits to New Caledonia by inviting visiting missions of the United Nations. Apart from New Caledonia, there are other Pacific islands still under the shackles of colonialism. It is our hope that the Administering Authorities concerned will accord genuine self-determination to these countries. We in the Pacific have always been aware of the importance of protecting the environment. Indeed, the cultural and physical survival of many of our countries depends on the proper management of that environment. The Convention for the protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, to which I referred earlier, is a clear indication of the importance we attach to this issue. We are greatly concerned that, in spite of ominous warnings about the future of this Earth, expected climatic changes and predictions of dramatic rises in the levels of the sea, gases responsible for the greenhouse effect continue to be emitted without strict regulation. It is our fervent hope that countries, particularly industrialized countries,  will effect significant cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases, including the establishment of obligatory emission reduction standards. We continue to oppose the disposal of toxic waste at sea unless it conforms with standards Prescribed under the London dumping convention. The United States has taken stringent precautions in destroying chemical weapons on Johnston atoll. We take little comfort in suggestions that Johnston atoll should be the permanent disposal site for the American chemical weapons destruction programme. We urge the United States not to use the facility as a permanent site for the disposal of chemical weapons and toxic waste, and I express our firm belief that it should be closed done once the current operations have been completed. We will also continue strongly to oppose French nuclear testing at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls. Pacific islanders have close affinity to the sea, and their dependence upon its resources needs no emphasis. Papua New Guinea is, therefore, pleased with the progress made on the elimination of driftnet fishing. We welcome the decision taken by Japan to cease drift netting a year in advance of the date stipulated in resolution 441225. We urge the Government of Japan and other distant water fishing nations to enter into negotiations with us on acceptable arrangements. Papua New Guinea's desire to participate meaningfully in the resolution of regional problems brings us into regular interaction with member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has taken many important initiatives, particularly in the South-East Asian region, which we have fully supported. We would like to acknowledge with satisfaction the leading role that both the Soviet Union and the United States have played, in recent years, to reduce tensions in the world. Their efforts and those of other States in the United Nations Security Council deserve our full support. Papua New Guinea is aware that progress made in the search for solutions to problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Western Sahara, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula and southern Africa is directly related to the convergence of views between the super-Powers and the permanent members of the Security Council. Papua new Guinea welcomes the announcement by Viet Nam to withdraw its troops completely from Cambodia. we commend the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries, Australia and the United Nations Security Council, in devising the united formula for the resolution of the Cambodian problem. Papua New Guinea believes that United nations involvement is necessary in order to ensure free and fair elections in Cambodia. In the Korean peninsula, my Government looks forward to the re-unification of North and South Korea. We support initiatives by both nations to reach a peaceful re-unification of Korean people, and urge them to continue on the path of reconciliation. In the same time, we support the admission of both North and South Korea to the United Nations as full Members. We believe this will facilitate dialogue and hasten the re-Unification process. The question of northern Sahara appears to be nearing resolution. The Secretary-General's settlement proposals, announced  on 11 August 1988, offer the chance to resolve this thorny issue once and for all. Members of the United Nations have a responsibility to see that the people of Western Sahara are able to exercise their right to self-determination. Thus, the organization and the supervision of a referendum by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity must be allowed to take place. The situation in the Middle East continues to cause us grave concern. My Government has always maintained that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland, just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secure borders. These two conditions appear to be prerequisites if a lasting solution to this problem is to be achieved. We have strongly condemned the use of force as a means of solving disputes and, in this context, Papua New Guinea continues to be alarmed at and condemn Iraq's invasion and continued occupation of Kuwait since 2 August 1990. As a member of the United Nations, my Government is committed to supporting the trade and economic embargo against Iraq sponsored by the United Nations Security Council. We urge all members of this Assembly to continue to co-operate in seeking a peaceful solution to this crisis. My Government believes strongly that international pressure and sanctions have resulted in the gradual dismantling of the apartheid system. Developments in South Africa offer reason for guarded optimism. After years of oppression and injustice, the creation of a genuine non-racial democracy may at last be a real possibility. We have a continuing responsibility to encourage the process of reconciliation and democratic reconstruction. We are saddened by the recent riots in the black townships involving the rival groups of the African National Congress (ANC) and Zulu Inkatha movements, which have left so many people dead. It is our firm conviction that sanctions should be continued until apartheid is completely dismantled. Papua pew Guinea applauds the achievement of Namibia's independence and commends all patties who were involved in this exercise. There are many changes taking place in the world economy today. The move towards a single-market Europe in 1992, regional initiatives such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Group and the shift by Eastern European countries towards market-oriented economies have serious implications for developing countries. The continuing global economic recession have had a considerable adverse impact on the economic and social well-bring of all nations. Inflation, high interestrates, a change-rate instability, rising unemployment, slow growth andprotectionism have all taken their toll on our national economies. On a positive side, Eastern Europe's economic transition could offer new opportunities for developing economies through increased demand for their commodities. We believe that closer co-operation between developed and developing countries now are more important than ever. The benefits from new markets in Eastern Europe need to be evenly shared if open trading relations are to be maintained. The possible harmful impact on the financial resources available to the developing world must be minimised. The formation of the Asia-Pacific economic co-operation group is intended to develop closer co-operation between countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and also to accommodate developments taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. The Lome IV Convention, which was signed on 15 December 1989, contains new concepts and ideas, which make it different from the three preceding arrangements. Lome IV contains increased financial packages for Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and includes now provisions for structural adjustments and assistance to ACP countries facing severe balance-of-payments difficulties. It is of considerable importance to ACP countries that the levels of development assistance agreed to in Lome IV remain unaffected by the opening up of Eastern Europe's wider contacts in the rest of the world. Any adjustment or restructuring of the world trading and financial system must not adversely affect   the position of the developing countries. The shifting of focus as well as the diversion of financial resources for developed countries to Eastern Europe, would greatly disadvantage the economies of the developing countries, whose claims to a more equitable distribution of the world's resources have been outstanding for decades. It is important that an open world trading system be maintained if economic prosperity is to be distributed  fairly. A strengthened general Agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT) is essential if we are to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade, and to make possible the full integration of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as developing countries, into the global economy. we believe that the highest priority on theinternational economic agenda is the need for a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of talks at the end of this year. Difficult political decisions will have to be taken in order to achieve far-reaching and substantive results from all the items to be discussed at the Uruguay round.  The remarkable political and economic changes that are taking place betweenthe super-powers in respect of Central and Eastern Europe, and those that are taking place in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and elsewhere, point to the emergence of a new world order , with shifting alliances and economic groupings. Papua New Guinea is confident that the United Nations will address these issues and devise measures that will allow member States to cope with the uncertainties that lie ahead. We continue to support the United Nations in its unique role in the resolution of conflict, and in the building of a strong framework for international co-operation. Over the years we have supported the work of the United Nations because we believe it to be vital to the continuing development of a peaceful and prosperous world community. Finally, we assure you, Mr. President, and the Secretary-General of our continued support for efforts to maintain end develop the work of the United Nations.
