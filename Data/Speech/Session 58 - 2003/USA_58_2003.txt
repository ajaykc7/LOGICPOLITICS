Twenty-four months ago, and
yesterday in the memory of America, the centre of New
York City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and
the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,
terrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in
9

Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,
measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and
innocent suffering they leave behind.
Last month, terrorists brought their war to the
United Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters
in Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that
reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.
Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio
Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave
man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in
Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,
Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and
was aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.
America joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the
memory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory
of all those who died with him in the service of the
United Nations.
By the victims they choose and by the means they
use, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.
Those who target relief workers for death have set
themselves against all humanity. Those who incite
murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for
life itself. They have no place in any religious faith,
they have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they
should have no friend in this Hall.
Events during the past two years have set before
us the clearest of divides: between those who seek
order and those who spread chaos, between those who
work for peaceful change and those who adopt the
methods of gangsters, between those who honour the
rights of man and those who deliberately take the lives
of men, women and children without mercy or shame.
Between those alternatives there is no neutral
ground. All Governments that support terror are
complicit in a war against civilization. No Government
should ignore the threat of terror because to look the
other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit
and prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives
of their own people depended on it will earn the
favourable judgement of history.
The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew
those alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban
was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When
confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime
is no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today,
now represents a free people who are building a decent
and just society. They are building a nation fully joined
in the war against terror.
The regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to
terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It
used those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused
to account for them when confronted by the world. The
Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security
Council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its
illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The
Security Council was right to vow serious
consequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because
there were consequences   because a coalition of
nations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of
the United Nations   Iraq is free, and today we are
joined by the representatives of a liberated country.
Saddam Hussain's monuments have been
removed, and not only his statues. The true monuments
of his rule and his character   the torture chambers,
the rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent
children   are closed. And as we discover the killing
fields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of
Saddam's cruelty is being revealed.
The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and
challenges, like every nation that has set out on the
path of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of
dignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the
squalid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,
life is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle
East, people are safer because an unstable aggressor
has been removed from power. Across the world,
nations are more secure because an ally of terror has
fallen.
Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were
supported by many Governments, and America is
grateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the
sovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our
actions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among
us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the
United Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our
collective security and to the advance of human rights.
Those permanent commitments call us to great work in
the world, work that we must do together. So, let us
move forward. First, we must stand with the people of
Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable
countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight
this progress above all because free people embrace
hope over resentment and choose peace over violence.
The United Nations has been a friend of the
Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping
refugees return home, advising on a new constitution
10

and helping to prepare the way for nationwide
elections. NATO has taken over the United Nations
mandated security force in Kabul. American and
coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda
terrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts
to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed
to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan
reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to
continue contributing to that important cause.
In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is
carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the
end of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children
under age five will have been immunized against
preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and
measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of
UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,
delivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,
thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food
Programme.
Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting its
responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids
against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.
Those killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They
have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.
And they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure
that Iraq's former dictator will never again use
weapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing
Iraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime
to reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and
its long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi
police, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi
people can assume full responsibility for their own
security.
At the same time, our coalition is helping to
improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old
regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we
are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old
regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have
helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The
old regime built up armies and weapons while allowing
the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are
rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation
facilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to
Congress that the United States provide additional
funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial
commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.
Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour
our pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people
build a stable and peaceful country we will make our
own countries more secure.
The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-
government for the people of Iraq, reached by an
orderly and democratic process. That process must
unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried
nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the
United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of
Iraqi self-government.
America is working with friends and allies on a
new Security Council resolution, which will expand the
United Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of
other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in
developing a constitution, training civil servants and
conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a
Governing Council, the first truly representative
institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are
showing the openness and tolerance that democracy
requires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every
young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the
nation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all
nations of good will should step forward and provide
that support.
The success of a free Iraq will be watched and
noted throughout the region. Millions will see that
freedom, equality and material progress are possible at
the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will
face the clearest evidence that free institutions and
open societies are the only path to long-term national
success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East
would benefit the entire world by undermining the
ideologies that export violence to other lands.
Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to
destabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will
have great power to inspire the Middle East. The
advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an
example that others, including the Palestinian people,
would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is
betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old
hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The
Palestinian people deserve their own State. They will
gain that State by embracing new leaders committed to
reform, to fighting terror and to building peace.
All parties in the Middle East must meet their
responsibilities and carry out the commitments they
made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the
conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State
to emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other
11

support for terrorist organizations. America will work
with every nation in the region that acts boldly for the
sake of peace.
A second challenge we must confront together is
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and the means to deliver them
would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in
entire regions. Those weapons could be used by
terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a
scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination
of outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of
mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished
away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,
all words, all protests, will come too late.
Nations of the world must have the wisdom and
the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One
crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at
their source. For more than a decade, the United States
has worked with Russia and other States of the former
Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons
and dangerous materials left over from another era.
Last year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to
provide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the
United States, to fight this proliferation risk over the
next ten years. Since then, six additional countries have
joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other
nations to help us meet this danger.
We are also improving our capability to interdict
lethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation
Security Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to
search planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect
cargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that
raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed
on a set of interdiction principles consistent with
current legal authorities, and we are working to expand
the Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.
We are determined to keep the world's most destructive
weapons away from all our shores and out of the hands
of our common enemies.
Because proliferators will use any route or
channel that is open to them, we need the broadest
possible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the
United Nations Security Council to adopt a new
antiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call
on all Members of the United Nations to criminalize
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to
enact strict export controls consistent with international
standards and to secure any and all sensitive materials
within their own borders. The United States stands
ready to help any nation draft these new laws and to
assist in their enforcement.
A third challenge we share is a challenge to our
conscience. We must act decisively to meet the
humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has
begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale
and treating millions who have the disease already. We
have pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight
AIDS around the world.
My country is acting to save lives from famine as
well. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in
global emergency food aid, and I have asked our
United States Congress for 200 million dollars for a
new famine fund so that we can act quickly when the
first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every
continent should generously add their resources to the
fight against disease and desperate hunger.
There is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,
yet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to
nine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold
or forced across the world's borders. Among them are
hundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as
young as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This
commerce in human life generates billions of dollars
each year, much of which is used to finance organized
crime. There is a special evil in the abuse and
exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The
victims of the sex trade see little of life before they see
the very worst of life   an underground of brutality
and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and
profit from their suffering must be severely punished.
Those who patronize this industry debase themselves
and deepen the misery of others, and Governments that
tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.
This problem has appeared in my own country
and we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I
signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any
person to enter the United States or for any citizen to
travel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving
children. The Department of Justice is actively
investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can
face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking
Victims Protection Act, the United States is using
sanctions against Governments to discourage human
trafficking.
12

The victims of this industry also need help from
Members of the United Nations. This begins with clear
standards and the certainty of punishment under the
laws of every country. Today, some nations make it a
crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct
should be a crime in all nations. Governments should
inform travellers of the harm this industry does and the
severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. The
American Government is committing $50 million to
support the good work of organizations that are
rescuing women and children from exploitation and
giving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of
a new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.
We must show new energy in fighting back an old
evil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the
transatlantic slave trade and more than a century after
slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the
trade in human beings for any purpose must not be
allowed to thrive in our time.
All the challenges I have spoken of this morning
require urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping
Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a
transformed region; cutting off the avenues of
proliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  
these are the kinds of great tasks for which the United
Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion
is needed and, also, decisive action. Our good
intentions will be credited only if we achieve good
outcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations
Charter, the United States of America is committed to
the United Nations and we show that commitment by
working to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes
and by giving meaning to its ideals.
The founding documents of the United Nations
and the founding documents of America stand in the
same tradition. Both assert that human beings should
never be reduced to objects of power or commerce,
because their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a
moral law that stands above men and nations, but
which must be defended and enforced by men and
nations. And both point the way to peace   the peace
that comes when all are free. We secure that peace with
our courage and we must show that courage together.
