Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over. I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest. 1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind.
Instead of uniting the nations, this  body became a forum for distrust and division among nations. 47 years later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and dreams have awakened again.
The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished. imperial communism has collapsed in its birthplace. Russia has awakened democratic, independent and free; the Baltic States are free.
This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other independent States, I say welcome home. With the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to forge a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the world faces three major challenges. He says the challenges include keeping today's peace and preventing tomorrow's wars. The need for enhanced peace-keeping capabilities has never been greater, he says.
The need for enhanced peace-keeping capabilities has never been greater. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is truly the fastest growing security challenge to peace and order. We face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for all.
The United States is changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. We too must change our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the promises of today.
Peace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their services increase. The need for monitoring and preventive peace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts may be especially critical in volatile regions.
We need only to look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and withurasia. We fully support the efforts of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU) and other competent regional peace-keeping organizations.
I welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across the globe. Nations should develop and train military units for possible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief. These forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council.
Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have a long history of peace-keeping. They can tap into that experience as we train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also require coordinated command and control.
Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and intelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations.Fifth, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations                 and associated peace-keepers efforts.
I have directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on peace-keeping. We will emphasize training of combat, engineering and logistical units. There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will play a part.
The United States is prepared to make available our bases and facilities for multinational training and field exercises. America used these bases to win the cold war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace.
The U.S. will review how we fund peace-keeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United Nations humanitarian activities. Over 20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for                 non-proliferation enforcement. Reaffirming  assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons was negotiated.
I believe we must explore ways we can strengthen linkages between the suppliers "clubs", the nuclear-suppliers  group, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United Nations specialized agencies. I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation ��Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995.
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus on non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global defence.
The United States will be strongly engaged with its global partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for a new era. I affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and enhances Europe's capability.
Economic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world. Fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic engine.
Foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to mutually productive economic relationships.
The more a nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of growth. The more open to trade and investment a country is, the better its growth. I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions.
The Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be charity but promote mutual prosperity.
The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 nations, to enhance global growth. States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring.
With the loss of so much that was familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves. Walls against trade, walls against people, Walls against ideas and investment, wallsagainst anything at all that appears new and different.
"A more peaceful, more  secure, more prosperous future beckons to us," he said. "Let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United Nations"
