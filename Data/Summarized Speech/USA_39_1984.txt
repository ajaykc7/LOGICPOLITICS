In 1983 we helped Israel and Lebanon reach an agreement that could have led to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. This agreement was blocked, and the long agony of the Lebanese continues.

I want to speak to the General Assembly today on what the United States and the Soviet Union can accomplish together in the coming years. I set out three objectives for United States-Soviet relations.
I propose that our two countries agree to embark on periodic consultations at policy level about regional problems. We will be prepared, if the Soviets agree, to make senior experts available at regular intervals for in-depth exchanges of views. I have asked Secretary of State Shultz to explore this with Foreign Minister Gromyko.
Spheres of influence are a thing of the past. Differences between American and Soviet interests are not. I am committed to redoubling our negotiating efforts to achieve real results.

U.S. and the Soviets have agreed to upgrade our hotline communications facility. We think there are other possibilities for improving communications in this area that deserve serious exploration.
I hope we can begin these talks by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. We have reached agreements to improve our hotline, extend our 10-year economic agreement, enhance consular co-operation and explore co-ordination of search and rescue efforts at sea.
I feel particularly strongly about breaking down the barriers between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union. We need to extend the arms control process, to build a bigger umbrella under which it can operate. This can greatly assist step-by-step negotiations and enablify the world.
We need a fresh approach to reducing international tensions. We need a framework for arms control under which it can operate. This can greatly assist step-by-step negotiations and enable us to avoid having all our hopes or expectations ride on any single set of negotiations.
Towards this end I will suggest to the Soviet Union that we institutionalize regular ministerial or cabinet-level meetings between our two countries. We would also welcome the exchange of observers at military exercises and locations. And I propose that we find a way for Soviet experts to come to the United States nuclear-test site.
I hope that the Soviet Union will co-operate in this undertaking and reciprocate in a manner that will enable the two countries to establish the basis for verification for effective limits on underground nuclear testing.
Some may dismiss such proposals and my own optimism as simplistic American idealism. And they will point to the burdens of the modem world and to history. Well, yes, if we sit down and catalogue year by year, generation by generation, the famines, the plagues, the wars, the invasions mankind has endured, the list will grow so long. We have a moral obligation to try and try again.
